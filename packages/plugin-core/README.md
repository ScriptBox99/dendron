# Dendron

![Dendron Logo](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/logo-256.png)

Dendron is an **open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool**. It's a personal knowledge management solution (PKM) built specifically for developers and integrates natively with IDEs like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why

Most PKM tools will help you create notes but hit a wall trying to retrieve them past some threshold. That threshold varies with the tool â€” 100, 1000, 10 000, virtually everything stops working past 10k notes unless the human was super diligent about organizing their knowledge. Past this threshold, entropy wins and every query becomes a keyword search and scrolling through pages of results.

> Dendron's mission is to help **humans organize, find, and work with any amount of knowledge**.

It not only helps you create notes, but also retrieve them - retrieval works as well with ten notes as it does with ten thousand.

## How

Dendron builds on top of the past five decades of language design and developer tooling. We apply the key lessons from software to the management of general knowledge. We make managing general knowledge more like managing code, and your PKM more like an IDE for general knowledge.

## Design Principles

### Developer Centric

Dendron aims to create a world class developer experience for managing knowledge.

Our goal is to provide a tool with the efficiency of vim, the extensibility of emacs, and the approcahbility of VSCode.

What this means:

- dendron features are text centric and composables
- dendron provides the lowest friction interface for working with your knowledge base
- dendron optimizes for efficiency, speed, and keyboard focused ux
- dendron comes with sane defaults and the ability to customize to your liking
- dendron can be extended along any dimension

### Gradual Structure

Dendron extends markdown with structural primitives to make it easier to manage at scale and tooling on top to work with this structure.

Different knowledge bases require different levels of structure - a PKM used for keeping daily journals is different than a company wide knowledge base used by thousands of developers.

Dendron works with any level of structure, meaning you can take free form notes when starting out and gradually layer on more structure as your knowledge base grows more.

### Flexible and Consistent

Dendron is both flexible and consistent. It provides a consistent structure for all your notes and gives you the flexibility to change that structure.

In Dendron, you can refactor notes and Dendron will make sure that your PKM is consistent throughout. This means that you have the best of both worlds: a basic structure for the organization but the flexibility to change it.

## Features

Dendron has hundreds of features. The following is a list of highlights.

### It's just Plaintext

- manage using git
- use git blame to see individual edits

</a>

### Navigation

- explore relationships using backlinks
- navigate to notes, headers and arbitrary blocks
- visualize your knowledge base using the graph view

  </a>

### Refactor

- restructure your knowledge base without breaking links
- rename a single note or refactor using arbitrary regex
- rename and move individual sections within notes

</a>

### Vaults

- mix and match knowledge using vaults, a git backed folder for your notes
- use vaults to separate concerns, like personal notes and work notes
- publish vaults on git to collaborate and share knowledge with others

  </a>

### Publish

- export your knowledge base as a static (nextjs) site
- lookup locally and share globally with generated links
- manage what you publish using fine grained permissions on a per vault, per hiearchy and per note basis
